## Welcome to Tyler's Personal Website

Welcome to what will hopefully be a successfully operating webpage with stuff about me & some of my coding / programming accomplishments in ISAT 252! Stick around and have some cookies while you're here

## Some interesting facts about me...
- I ride a Harley Davidson Street Bob
- I have two Boston Terriers, Oreo & Harley (Yes, we named him after Harley-Davidson)
- Junior ISAT major @ James Madison University
- I am an Eagle Scout Recipient

## Harley (the boy) is front and center, Oreo (the girl) is in the background
